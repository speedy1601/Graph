Consider during the Graph Sections
● The graphs you are given will always be valid 
    ○ Input vertices are always in the range [0, N-1]
    
● If graph attributes are not specified assume: 
    ○ directed unweighted graph 
    ○ with possibly multiple edges and loops 
    ○ implemented using adjacency list 
    ○ If the graph is weighted: then weights are integers 
 
● In testing, always consider special graphs 
    ○ Graph of a single node (maybe with a loop) 
    ○ Graph of N nodes and zero edges 
    ○ Graph that is: chain, tree, complete, dense, sparse
